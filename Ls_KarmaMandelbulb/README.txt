This only works in Karma CPU and uses the example files from the HDK in:
	$HFS/toolkit/samples/karma_procedurals

The two .vfl files need to go in $HOUDINI_PATH/vex/CVex, e.g. on a Mac:
	/Users/lewis/Library/Preferences/houdini/20.5/vex/CVex

Crashes as soon as you change any of the attribs in 20.5.361 sadly ^_^
